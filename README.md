# Adventure_Work_PowerBI


1.The primary goal of the project was to enhance and update my Power BI skills by creating a business intelligence solution for Adventure Works Cycle, a global manufacturing company.

2.The first step in the process was to connect and transform the raw data obtained from various sources, including databases and spreadsheets. This involved cleaning and shaping the data to make it ready for analysis and visualization.

3.Next, a relational data model was built to establish the relationships between different tables in the data model. This was a crucial step in creating accurate and efficient calculations and visualizations.

4.Calculated fields were added to the data model using DAX, a formula language that allows for complex calculations and analysis. This feature was used to create custom calculations, such as aggregations, filtering, and time intelligence, using simple expressions.

5.Finally, an interactive Power BI report was designed and built to provide end-to-end business intelligence solutions. The report included various visualizations such as charts, tables, and maps to help users explore and understand the data. The report was also formatted to make it visually appealing and easy to navigate.

By following these steps, a professional-quality, end-to-end business intelligence solution was delivered for Adventure Works Cycle, which can help users make informed decisions based on the data and drive business growth.
